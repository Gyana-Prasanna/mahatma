        <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
        <p>
            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi is the most popular historical figure in the nation. He was born in Porbandar,
            Gujarat, on October 2. His family was affluent, and he had a good reputation as a quiet-natured boy. He went
            to London for his higher education, where he studied law and became a Barrister. He practised law at the
            Bombay High Court upon his return to India.

            Gandhiji later moved to South Africa to work but soon lost interest in law. Instead, he joined hands with
            the natives there to start satyagraha â€“ a non-violent protest against the oppression of the Europeans. He
            soon returned to India and joined the struggle for independence from British rule.

            He was a simple man who taught simplicity and self-reliance to the people in India. He encouraged them to
            boycott foreign goods and make their own swadeshi goods. He was loved and respected by people of all
            communities.

            As a freedom fighter, Gandhi was a man of firm conviction. During his freedom struggle, the British had put
            him in jail several times, where he endured extreme hardships. To honour his role in the freedom struggle,
            his birthday is observed as a national holiday to pay homage to him and all others who stood with him.
